I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹, a Research Scientist at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), Meta's fundamental AI research group. I currently split my time between London and Cambridge. 

While machine learning is often thought of as a pipeline from data to decision, my research investigates the orthogonal pipeline from researcher decisions to impacts, both positive and negative, in broader society.
The choices we make as researchers---how to collect data, which model architecture to use, how we evaluate performance or even how we define the question---result in different conclusions, different systems, and ultimately different outcomes for those our systems affect.

In 2022 I completed my PhD in machine learning as part of the [ML@CL group](https://mlatcl.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/).
Previously, I have studied at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), obtained a master's in natural language processing at the Cambridge [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), and did my bachelor's in computer science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

In between, I've simulated financial crises in market risk at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), built new retail banks at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), and developed next generation credit scores at [Credit Kudos](https://creditkudos.com/).

I'm also the Founder and Chair of [The Preptrack Foundation](https://preptrack.co.uk), a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates the risk of HIV infection.
