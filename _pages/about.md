I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹, a Research Scientist at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), the fundamental AI research group of Meta's Superintelligence Labs. I split my time between London and Cambridge, UK.

My research is broadly focused on both evaluating and improving the reliability of LLMs.
I'm particularly interested in understanding model performance in novel or out-of-distribution scenarios, such as prompts unlike those seen during pre- or post-training.
I'm also very excited by techniques for better handling uncertainty, ranging from missing training data to ambiguous user intent.

I joined FAIR London in 2023 after a postdoc with FAIR Paris. 
In 2022 I completed my PhD in machine learning as part of the [ML@CL group](https://mlatcl.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/).
Previously, I have studied at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), obtained a master's in natural language processing at the Cambridge [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), and did my bachelor's in computer science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

In between, I've simulated financial crises in market risk at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), built new retail banks at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), and developed next generation credit scores at [Credit Kudos](https://creditkudos.com/).

<!-- I'm also the Founder and Chair of [The Preptrack Foundation](https://preptrack.co.uk), a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates the risk of HIV infection. -->
