I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹, a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), Meta's fundamental AI research group. I currently split my time between Paris, France and Cambridge, UK. 

While machine learning is often thought of as a pipeline from data to decision, my research investigates the orthogonal pipeline from researcher decisions to impacts, both positive and negative, in broader society.
The choices we make as researchers---how to collect data, which model architecture to use, how we evaluate performance or even how we define the question---result in different conclusions, different systems, and ultimately different outcomes for those our systems affect.

For example, my recent [NeurIPS paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/750337e1301941f81ae31a90e0a1c181-Abstract-Conference.html) applied an approximated multiverse analysis in order to understand the effect of researcher choices on the robustness of scientific claims, and my recent [FAccT paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3593013.3594003), connecting contemporary models' inductive bias towards simplicity to performance disparities, showed that the choice of model architecture can have real, yet unpredictable, impact.
In broad strokes, my work aims to highlight the active and concrete role that researchers and model developers must play in creating fair and equitable machine learning systems, no matter how abstract or fundamental our research may seem.

In 2022 I completed my PhD in machine learning as part of the [ML@CL group](https://mlatcl.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/).
Previously, I have studied at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), obtained a master's in natural language processing at the Cambridge [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), and did my bachelor's in computer science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

In between, I've simulated financial crises in market risk at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), built new retail banks at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), and developed next generation credit scores at [Credit Kudos](https://creditkudos.com/).

I'm also the Founder and Chair of [The Preptrack Foundation](https://preptrack.co.uk), a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates the risk of HIV infection.
