I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹, a final year machine learning PhD student in the [ML@CL group](https://mlatcl.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof. Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/).

My research focuses on understanding how contemporary machine learning models actually work. Broadly, I'm interested in reproducibility and metascientific research, tooling and theory for improving the efficiency of machine learning research, and understanding algorithmic biases and questions of fairness.

Previously, I was a placement student at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), did my master's in deep learning for natural language processing at the Cambridge [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/), and did a bachelor's in computer science at the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

In between, I've worked on algorithmic bias at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/); simulated financial crises in market risk at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com); built new retail banks at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), and developed next generation credit scores at [Credit Kudos](https://creditkudos.com/).

I'm also the Founder and Chair of [The Preptrack Foundation](https://preptrack.co.uk), a registered charity building  technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.

If you're interested in what I do, research collaborations or opportunities, please do drop me a line. My email is sjb326 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk. I'd love to hear from you.
