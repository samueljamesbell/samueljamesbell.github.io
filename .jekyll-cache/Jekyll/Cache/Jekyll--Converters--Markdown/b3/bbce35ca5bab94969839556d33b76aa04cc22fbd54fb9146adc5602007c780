I"j<p>I try to understand learning in both humans and machines.</p>

<p>At present I’m working on using neural networks as models of visual
perceptual learning in adult humans. Specifically, I’m interested in modelling
known behavioural phenomena such as limited generalisation, and investigating
the general properties and mechanisms of human learning. Neural networks provide a perfect 
test bed for thinking about learning in the brain as a dynamic process.</p>

<p>I’m studying for PhD in the <a href="https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Psychology</a> at the University of Cambridge (Queens’ College),
supervised by <a href="https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?zkourtzi">Prof. Zoe Kourtzi</a> and <a href="https://inverseprobability.com/">Prof. Neil Lawrence</a>. During my master’s I worked on deep learning and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">natural language processing</a> at the Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer
Laboratory</a>. I did my bachelor’s in computer science at the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">University of
Manchester</a>, graduating 2013.</p>

<p>In between, I’ve also simulated financial crises in market risk at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com">Goldman
Sachs</a>, built new
retail banks at <a href="https://www.thoughtmachine.net/">Thought Machine</a>, and developed next generation credit
scores at <a href="https://creditkudos.com/">Credit Kudos</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in what I do, research collaborations or 
opportunities, please do drop me a line. My email is sjb326 [at] cam
