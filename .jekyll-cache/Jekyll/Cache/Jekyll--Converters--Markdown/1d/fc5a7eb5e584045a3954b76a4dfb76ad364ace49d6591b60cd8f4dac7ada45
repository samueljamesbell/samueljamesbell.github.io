I"<p>I apply the principles and methods of psychology to understanding neural network behaviour.</p>

<p>I’m a machine learning PhD student in the <a href="https://mlatcl.github.io/">ML@CL group</a> at the University of Cambridge (Queens’ College), supervised by <a href="https://inverseprobability.com/">Prof. Neil Lawrence</a>, and a placement student at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk">The Alan Turing Institute</a>. During my master’s I worked on deep learning and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/">natural language processing</a> at the Cambridge <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Computer
Laboratory</a>. I did my bachelor’s in computer science at the <a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">University of
Manchester</a>, graduating 2013.</p>

<p>In between, I’ve also simulated financial crises in market risk at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com">Goldman
Sachs</a>, built new
retail banks at <a href="https://www.thoughtmachine.net/">Thought Machine</a>, and developed next generation credit
scores at <a href="https://creditkudos.com/">Credit Kudos</a>.</p>

<p>I’m also the Founder and Chair of <a href="https://preptrack.co.uk">The Preptrack Foundation</a>, a registered charity building<br />
technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use
PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.</p>
