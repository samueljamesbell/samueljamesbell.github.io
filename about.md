I apply the principles and methods of psychology to understanding neural network behaviour.

I'm a machine learning PhD student in the [ML@CL group](https://mlatcl.github.io/) at the University of Cambridge (Queens' College), supervised by [Prof. Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/). During my master's I worked on deep learning and [natural language processing](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the Cambridge [Computer
Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/). I did my bachelor's in computer science at the [University of
Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/), graduating 2013.

In between, I've also simulated financial crises in market risk at [Goldman
Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com), built new
retail banks at [Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/), and developed next generation credit
scores at [Credit Kudos](https://creditkudos.com/).

I'm also the Founder and Chair of [The Preptrack Foundation](https://preptrack.co.uk), a registered charity building  
technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, Preptrack, helps people who use
PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.

If you're interested in what I do, research collaborations or 
opportunities, please do drop me a line. My email is sjb326 [at] cam
[dot] ac [dot] uk.
